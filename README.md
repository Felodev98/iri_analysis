iri_analysis is a tool designed for analyzing International Roughness Index (IRI) data. It provides scripts and utilities for processing, visualizing, and interpreting road surface roughness measurements. The project aims to assist engineers and researchers in evaluating pavement quality, identifying maintenance needs, and generating reports from IRI datasets.

## Features

- Import and clean IRI data from various formats
- Visualize IRI profiles and trends
- Generate summary statistics and reports
- Tools for comparing IRI across different road segments or time periods
